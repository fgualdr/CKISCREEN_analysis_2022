# CKISCREEN_analysis_2022
Codes to reproduce the analysis of the manuscript:
CKI are numbered from 01 to 58 and the map can be found in /data/KI_Annotations/

###01_DMSO_Impulse_and_Clustering.R
- Code to performed time-resolved differential analysis and CRE clustering of H3K27ac Chipseq signal in control (DMSO) condition using ImpulseDE2, UMAP/Louvain.
- The code can be run using the singularity image: docker://fgualdr/envimpulse

###02_Combine_ATLAS.R
- Code to combine ~200 TFs Chipseq (both signal and MCAS2 called peaks) together with H3K27ac LPS/IL4 time course and H3K27ac IFNB1 time course in control (unperturbed) conditions
- The code can be run using the singularity image: docker://fgualdr/envrgeneralg

03_Main_MFA_analysis_and_plots.R
- Code to perform the main analysis devoted to the integration of CKI effects employing MFA (Multiple Factor Analysis) from the FactomineR package.
